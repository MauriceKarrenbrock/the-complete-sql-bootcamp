# Final assessment test
## Create a database

I created my own database "my\_school\_database.tar" by using the commands saved as SQL files in this directory.
The instructions given were:
```
Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.

The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year.

The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name,

homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:

We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.

We must have ids as the primary key of the tables

Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.

Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.

Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321
