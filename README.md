# The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero
## Exercises of the course

In this repository you will find the exercises I did during the Udemy course [The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp)

The most interesting exercises are the assessment tests because they expect you to do something more than simply copying the lessons.

All the exercises use the dvdrental.tar database except for the assessment test 2 that uses the exercises.tar database and the assessment test 3 where we had to do your own database (you can find it in the directory as my_school_database.tar)
